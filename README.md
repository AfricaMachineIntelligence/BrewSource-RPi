BrewSource, a Raspberry Pi-powered monitor for your brewing :beers:. Written in :snake:Python and :sailboat:Sails.js

**Developed by:** Morten Amundsen.py, Svenn-Roger SÃ¸rensen.js

This repository is for our group project in the course IS-213, **_Open Source_**

- Developed in Python
- Using a [DS18B20 Waterproof Digital Temperature Sensor] (https://www.adafruit.com/product/381) to read temperatures

**The launcher.sh script is used to run the python script on reboot**

_In order to get this working, you'll need to do the following:_
```sh
sudo crontab -e
@reboot sh /home/pi/brewpi/launcher.sh >/home/pi/logs/cronlog 2>&1
```

**The Python script is dependent on a package called MySQLdb**

_To install this on your Pi, you'll need to run_
```sh
sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
```
